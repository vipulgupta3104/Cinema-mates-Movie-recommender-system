# Cinema Mates - Movie Recommender System

## Project Description

Cinema Mates is a machine learning-based movie recommendation system that suggests personalized movie options based on user preferences. The system analyzes movie features and user behavior to provide tailored suggestions.

Key features of the project:
- Developed using collaborative filtering techniques on the TMDB dataset
- Implements cosine similarity and feature extraction for recommendations
- Deployed as a web application using Flask framework. 
- Processes key movie features including genre, ratings, and metadata

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- Built with Python using machine learning libraries
- Utilizes cosine similarity for recommendation algorithms
- Processes TMDB dataset with comprehensive movie metadata
- Flask-based web interface for user interaction

### Features
- Content-based filtering using movie attributes
- Dynamic recommendation generation
- User-friendly web interface
- Scalable architecture for large datasets

## Usage

The system can be used to:
1. Get personalized movie recommendations
2. Discover similar movies based on your favorites
3. Explore movie metadata and relationships


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## Future Work

Potential enhancements include:
- Integration with user rating systems
- Hybrid recommendation approaches
- Expanded movie database
- User profile and history features
- Deployment to cloud platforms
