Access the project: https://cinema-mates.onrender.com

- Developed and deployed a content-based movie recommender system using Flask and machine learning that suggests movies based on user input by analyzing features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- Preprocessed the TMDB dataset (containing metadata of over 5,000 movies), applied NLP techniques, and built a cosine similarity matrix to identify and recommend top 5 similar movies.
- Integrated a modern frontend using HTML, CSS, and Select2.js with a searchable dropdown to enhance user experience and provide live autocomplete suggestions.
- The entire pipeline, from vectorization to deployment, was implemented using scikit-learn, pandas, and Flask, and is hosted on Render for public use.
